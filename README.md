# CNN-for-Pathology-Report-Classification

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

By Tianxiang Chen (ORNL Research Assistant)

This project presents how to use Covolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to solve Pathology report classification problem. CNNs are always considered as good at processing image data. But this project shows that CNNs can also achieve good performance in Nature Language Processing (NLP). 

In this project, we use pretrained [GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) model to convert pathology reports to vector matrix.

### Prerequisities

Required softwares:
    [neon 1.5.4+485033c](http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html)
    CUDA 7.5

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
